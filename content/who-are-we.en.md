Effective Altruism Groningen wants to encourage and enable individuals and organizations in Groningen and its surroundings to do the most good as possible. We do this following the principles of Effective Altruism.

EA-Groningen aims to be a broad community of effective altruists who mutually inspire and inform each other to maximize their impact. This can be informally (by connecting socially), or by forming a committee and working together on a specific challenge.

Our community is comprised of people who:

- (aim to) donate money to the most effective charities
- actively spread the ideas of effective altruism
- (aspire to) have an EA-career
- make EA-choices in their daily life
- do a combination of the above

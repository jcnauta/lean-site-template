## Reading Material
<br>

A lot of material has been developed on how we can go about doing a lot of good. Here is some of the best.


If you like TED talks, watch Peter Singer’s **[The Why and How of Effective Altruism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Diuv3XZQXyc)** or check out **[any of the other TED talks and presentations on effective altruism](http://effective-altruism.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_EA_Presentations)**. The Life You Can Save (Singer’s first book on Effective Altruism) **[in 3 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onsIdBanynY)** is also a great watch.


A great place to start is this **[introductory list on the EA forum](http://www.effective-altruism.com/ea/6x/introduction_to_effective_altruism/)**. Ryan Carey has also put this in a more detailed **[pdf format](http://www.careyryan.com/files/EA_Handbook.pdf)**.


Ben Kuhn compiles a great set of articles **[here](http://www.benkuhn.net/ea-reading)**.

A good primer on GiveWell, global poverty reduction (and charities in general): **[Giving 101: the basics](http://www.givewell.org/giving101)**


Peter McIntyre write a post summarising charity selection heuristics, and some cause areas: **[Effective charities 101](http://mcntyr.com/effective-charities-101/)**


How should you spend your 80 000 hours of your working life? 80 000 Hours (where did they get the name from?) has put together an **[incredible guide on careers](https://80000hours.org/career-guide/)**.


Singer’s books: **[The Life You Can Save](http://www.amazon.com/The-Life-You-Can-Save/dp/0812981561)**, and **[The Most Good You Can Do](http://www.amazon.com/The-Most-Good-You-Can/dp/0300180276)** are good introductions, and have changed many people’s lives.


Will MacAskill’s book, **[Doing Good Better](http://www.amazon.com/Doing-Good-Better-Effective-Difference/dp/1592409105/)**, introducing effective altruism was published in August 2015.


Additionally, many individual writers and other sites have interesting material on effective altruism – you can find some **[great blogs](https://eahub.org/links#blogs)** on the EA Hub.
